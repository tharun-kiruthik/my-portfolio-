# Tharun Kiruthik — Portfolio (hello.html)

A simple, responsive single-page portfolio built with plain HTML and CSS.

## Overview

- **File:** hello.html
- **Purpose:** Showcases an "About Me" section, a Projects grid, and Contact information with a clean, responsive layout and subtle hover effects.
- **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS (no frameworks or JS).

## Structure

- Header with site title and navigation links to sections (`About`, `Projects`, `Contact`).
- `#about` section: short bio.
- `#projects` section: grid of project cards with hover lift effect.
- `#contact` section: email and phone placeholder.
- Footer with copyright.

## Usage

1. Open the project folder in your file manager or editor.
2. Open `hello.html` in any modern browser (double-click or right-click → Open with).

For a quick local preview you can use VS Code Live Server or a simple Python HTTP server:

- With Python 3 (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\tharu\OneDrive\Desktop\portfolio\MY PROFILE"
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000/hello.html in your browser
```

- With VS Code: install the Live Server extension and click "Go Live".

## Customization

- Edit content directly in `hello.html` to update text and projects.
- Modify styles inside the `<style>` block in the `<head>` or move them to a separate `styles.css` file.

## Notes

- Contact details are placeholders — replace with real info before publishing.
- No JavaScript is included; add interactivity as needed.
